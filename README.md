# MOVIE-RECOMMENDER-SYSTEM
**Recommender System**

**1. Importing the Dependencies:**
   - I begin by importing the necessary libraries and modules, such as pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms, and other required packages.

**2. Loading the Data:**
   - Next, I load the dataset containing information about users, movies, and their ratings. This dataset serves as the foundation for building our recommender system.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - I conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. This includes analyzing the distribution of ratings, identifying popular movies, exploring user behavior, and any patterns or trends present in the data.

**4. Data Preprocessing:**
   - Before applying any machine learning algorithms, I preprocess the data to ensure it is in a suitable format. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

**5. Collaborative Filtering Using K Nearest Neighbors:**
   - One approach to building a recommender system is through collaborative filtering. I utilize the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scikit-learn to find similar items based on user-item interactions. This method predicts user preferences by considering the ratings of similar users or items.

**6. Movie-Based Recommender System:**
   - I implement a movie-based recommender system that suggests movies based on their ratings. This approach prioritizes movies with higher average ratings or greater popularity among users.

**7. Handling Cold Start Problem with Content-Based Filtering:**
   - To address the cold start problem, where new users or items lack sufficient data for collaborative filtering, I incorporate content-based filtering. This method recommends items similar to those previously rated by the user, leveraging features such as movie genres or descriptions.

**8. Dimensionality Reduction with Matrix Factorization:**
   - Another technique I employ in my recommender system is dimensionality reduction with matrix factorization. Specifically, I utilize Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce the dimensionality of the user-item utility matrix. This allows me to capture latent features and improve the efficiency of the recommendation process.

In summary, my recommender system leverages various techniques, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and matrix factorization, to provide personalized movie recommendations to users while addressing challenges such as the cold start problem. Through exploratory data analysis and preprocessing, I ensure the quality and reliability of my recommendations, ultimately enhancing the user experience.
